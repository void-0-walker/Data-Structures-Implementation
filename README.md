# Data-Structures-Implementation
This is made for those who are planning (Beginners) to learn Data Structures and need a reference.
Contains implementation of various data structures like Stack, Queue, Heap, Graph, BST, AVL Tree etc. in Java.
The implementation may not be the best. But I have tried to make it as good as possible and easy to understand.
Any advice to improve the code would be appreciated.
NOTE: Graph using Adjacency Matrix is incomplete.
